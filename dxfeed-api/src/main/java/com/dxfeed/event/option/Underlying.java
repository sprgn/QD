/**
 * Underlying event is a snapshot of computed values that are available for an option underlying
 * symbol based on the option prices on the market.
 * It represents the most recent information that is available about the corresponding values on
 * the market at any given moment of time.
 *
 * <h3>Properties</h3>
 *
 * {@code Underlying} event has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getEventSymbol() eventSymbol} - symbol of this event;
 * <li>{@link #getEventFlags() eventFlags} - transactional event flags;
 * <li>{@link #getIndex() index} - unique per-symbol index of this event;
 * <li>{@link #getTime() time} - timestamp of this event in milliseconds;
 * <li>{@link #getSequence() sequence} - sequence number of this event to distinguish events that have the same {@link #getTime() time};
 * <li>{@link #getVolatility() volatility} - 30-day implied volatility for this underlying based on VIX methodology;
 * <li>{@link #getFrontVolatility() frontVolatility} - front month implied volatility for this underlying based on VIX methodology;
 * <li>{@link #getBackVolatility() backVolatility} - 3back month implied volatility for this underlying based on VIX methodology;
 * <li>{@link #getPutCallRatio() putCallRatio} - ratio of put traded volume to call traded volume for a day.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3><a name="eventFlagsSection">Event flags, transactions and snapshots</a></h3>
 *
 * Some Underlying sources provide a consistent view of the set of known Underlying events.
 * The corresponding information is carried in {@link #getEventFlags() eventFlags} property.
 * The logic behind this property is detailed in {@link IndexedEvent} class documentation.
 * Multiple event sources for the same symbol are not supported for Underlying, thus
 * {@link #getSource() source} property is always {@link IndexedEventSource#DEFAULT DEFAULT}.
 *
 * <p>{@link TimeSeriesEventModel} class handles all the snapshot and transaction logic and conveniently represents
 * a list current of time-series events order by their {@link #getTime() time}.
 * It relies on the code of {@link AbstractIndexedEventModel} to handle this logic.
 * Use the source code of {@link AbstractIndexedEventModel} for clarification on transactions and snapshot logic.
 *
 * <h3>Publishing Underlying</h3>
 *
 * Publishing of Underlying events follows the general rules explained in {@link TimeSeriesEvent} class
 * documentation.
 *
 * <p>See <a href="package-summary.html#model">the model section</a> for a mathematical background on
 * the values in this event.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation details</h3>
 *
 * This event is implemented on top of QDS record {@code Underlying}.
